# CIFAR

## What is CIFAR?

The [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset (Canadian Institute For Advanced Research) is a collection of images that are commonly used to train machine learning and computer vision algorithms. It is one of the most widely used datasets for machine learning research.


## Why it is used in deep learning?

CIFAR-10 is a set of images that can be used to teach a computer how to recognize objects. Since the images in CIFAR-10 are low-resolution (32x32), this dataset can allow researchers to quickly try different algorithms to see what works. CIFAR-10 is a labeled subset of the **80 million tiny images** dataset.


The CIFAR-10 dataset contains 60,000 32x32 color images in *10* different classes.

## Convolutional Neural Network

In deep learning, a convolutional neural network (CNN, or ConvNet) is a class of artificial neural network (ANN), most commonly applied to analyze visual imagery. CNNs are also known as Shift Invariant or Space Invariant Artificial Neural Networks (SIANN), based on the shared-weight architecture of the convolution kernels or filters that slide along input features and provide translation-equivariant responses known as feature maps. Counter-intuitively, most convolutional neural networks are not invariant to translation, due to the downsampling operation they apply to the input. They have applications in [image and video recognition](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/06/image-processing-using-cnn-a-beginners-guide/), [recommender systems](https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-learning-based-recommender-systems-3d120201db7e), [image classification](geeksforgeeks.org/image-classifier-using-cnn/), image segmentation, [medical image analysis](https://journalofbigdata.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40537-019-0276-2#:~:text=CNN%20on%20medical%20image%20classification&text=The%20CNN%2Dbased%20deep%20neural,complicated%20and%20expensive%20feature%20engineering.), natural language processing,     **brainâ€“computer interfaces**, and financial time series.
